# NRAO (Non root android optimizer) ðŸš€
A non-root android optimizer, as the name tells. Powered by [Shizuku](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=moe.shizuku.privileged.api).

## Usage ðŸ”¢
After downloading the zip from given sources, rename downloaded zip to `NRAO.zip`, execute the following code in Termux but make sure that the zip is in Internal Storage / Download:
```
termux-setup-storage
sh <path to rish file> # Start Shizuku shell.
mkdir -p /sdcard/Download/NRAO
unzip -qo /sdcard/Download/NRAO.zip -d /sdcard/Download/NRAO
sh /sdcard/Download/NRAO/run.sh
```
Do this again after every reboot because currently there is no automated method to execute NRAO on every reboot.
